## ✨ What is Soc Ops?

Soc Ops is a digital **Social Bingo game** designed to energize in-person gatherings, team building events, and networking sessions. Instead of small talk, participants search for people who match fun and interesting prompts on their bingo card.

**Perfect for:**
- 🏢 Team offsites and company events  
- 🎓 Classroom icebreakers  
- 🎉 Networking mixers  
- 👥 Community meetups  

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Get Your Card** – Each player receives a randomized 5×5 bingo card with unique prompts
2. **Mingle & Match** – Walk around and find people who match each square ("Has lived in another country", "Speaks 3+ languages", etc.)
3. **Mark Your Wins** – Tap squares as you find matches
4. **Bingo!** – First to complete 5 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins

The magic? Everyone's talking to *everyone*, and discovering unexpected connections along the way.
